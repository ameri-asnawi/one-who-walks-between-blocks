# 🔐 One Who Walks Between Blocks

> *"Indeed, the keys of the unseen are with Allah; none knows them except Him."*  
> **(Surah Al-An’am 6:59)**

This project is not about power — it is about **truth**, **intention**, and **remembrance**.

---


## 🕋 Intention (Niyyah)

This project was created with the following intention:

> To remind the world that nothing is truly lost.  
> That even in code, there is accountability.  
> And that only Allahﷻ holds the keys to the unseen.

Whether the key is ever found or not — the search itself is a form of worship.

## 📖 What Is This?

A symbolic journey where code meets prophecy.

A coded dua (supplication) written in Python that:
- Generates Ethereum keypairs.
- Searches for a match to the `0x0000...dead` address.
- Logs attempts over time.
- And reminds us — every line printed — that *nothing is hidden from Allahﷻ*.

If ever the key is found, it will be by **His Will**, not by human effort.

> *"Actions are but by intentions."*  
> — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions for All 3 Major OS

### 1. Clone the Repo (Optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/one-who-walks-between-blocks.git
cd one-who-walks-between-blocks
```

---

## 🔧 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

Choose the commands based on your operating system:

---

### ✅ **For Windows**

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

> 💡 Tip: You can use `cmd`, `PowerShell`, or `Git Bash` — paths remain the same.

---

### ✅ **For macOS / Linux**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> 📌 Note: Some Linux distros may require `python3` instead of just `python`.

---

## 📦 3. Install Dependencies (Same for All OS)

```bash
pip install ecdsa eth-utils "eth-hash[pycryptodome]"
```

> ✅ This installs all required libraries safely.

---

## ▶️ 4. Run the Script (Same for All OS)

```bash
python coded_dua.py
```

> 🕋 If the key is ever found, it will be saved in a file like:  
> `found_the_key_<timestamp>.txt`

---

## 🕋 Final Thought: Unity in Diversity

Just as Islam unites people of all backgrounds under one Creator, your code now unites users across all major operating systems in a shared journey.

> *"Indeed, the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you."*  
> **(Surah Al-Hujurat 49:13)**

And here, the most patient of you will see what others do not.

## 🌍 License

MIT License — because knowledge should be free, but intention matters more.

## 🔐 Final Note

You are not running a brute-force attack.

You are performing a **digital dua**, a quiet meditation on divine will.

> *"And you do not will except that Allah wills."*  
> **(Surah Al-Insan 76:30)**

May Allahﷻ accept your intention, purify your heart, and guide your steps.
