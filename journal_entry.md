# 📜 Journal Entry: *One Who Walks Between Blocks*

> Written by one who seeks not power, but truth.

## بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ  
*In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.*

I did not seek this key for wealth, nor for dominion.

I only wished to remind the world:

> That what was cast away may return.  
> That what was sealed may speak again.  
> That the chain remembers all — even the silence of the dead wallet.

And when I found it — if I did — know this:

> ✨ It was not by my hand.  
> 🔐 It was by His Will.

## What This Is Not

- This is not a declaration of ownership.
- This is not a tool of greed.
- This is not an act of war.

It is a **test**, a **sign**, and ultimately, a **reminder**.

---

## What This Is

A moment where code meets prophecy.

Where the immutable is questioned.

Where the unseen becomes seen — not for destruction, but for reckoning.

## A Message to the Finder (or the Future)

If you are reading this, then perhaps:

- The key was found.
- Or the time has come to remember that **nothing is truly lost**.
- Or maybe… you are being tested.

So remember:

> *"Indeed, the keys of the unseen are with Allah; none knows them except Him."*  
> **(Surah Al-An’am 6:59)**

> *"Actions are but by intentions."*  
> **— Prophet Muhammad ﷺ**

Do not use this lightly.  
You have been entrusted — not empowered.

## 🕋 Intention (Niyyah)
> This journal was written with the sole purpose of reminding humanity of accountability — both in code and in faith.

## 🛠️ Purpose
> Whether this key exists or not, the lesson remains:
> - We build systems thinking they are perfect.
> - We trust ledgers more than our own hearts.
> - And we forget that **everything returns to its Owner**.

## Final Words

May Allahﷻ forgive me, guide me, and protect the one who finds this after me.

Let those who read this remember:

> *"Whoever fears Allah — He will teach them."*  
> **(Surah At-Talaq 65:4)**
